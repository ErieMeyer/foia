[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) has created a delivery team to implement part of the [Open Government National Action Plan](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf)'s commitment to modernizing the Freedom of Information Act.

We are tasked with bringing technology to bear on this problem. We are *not tasked* with developing new regulations or legislation. Of course, neither policy nor technology exists in a vacuum, and they will depend heavily on each other.


## Where we are

18F works in the open, and so you can follow our work and project discussions on GitHub, centered at [18F's `foia` repository](https://github.com/18f/foia). You can use GitHub's "Watch" feature to be notified of ongoing discussion in that repository. We'll be trying to do as much project deliberation and stakeholder interaction as possible in GitHub.

Over time, the work will likely expand to include multiple repositories tackling more specific elements of the work, but our project-level discussions will remain at [`18f/foia`](https://github.com/18f/foia). So if you want to keep in close touch with the project, that's where to do it.

In *this* space ([18f.github.io/foia](https://18f.github.io/foia/)), the delivery team will write about our goals, plans, and progress. Compared to GitHub, updates will be less frequent and more narrative, but this is a **development blog** and so it will frequently be "in the weeds" and technical. You can use [our RSS feed](http://18f.github.io/foia/feed/) to follow our updates.


## Our plan

Our team's plan is to **reduce friction** for requestors and agencies in the FOIA process, **absorb the entropy** of petitioning a federated government of autonomous agencies, and **create a clear path** for the release of public records.

To this end, we're developing, or looking at developing:

* A **consolidated FOIA portal** for requestors. A central, user-facing front-end from which anyone can initiate a FOIA request to an agency in the federal government.
* A **working API and spec** for agencies to receive FOIA requests and resolve them. In other words, a common way for our portal to cleanly interoperate with an agency's existing or new FOIA processing systems -- at least at the very beginning and end of the process.
* An interface for **discovering public records** released through FOIA. At the very least, this means a public read API.
* A lightweight **application for FOIA offices** to track and process requests. It would use the same interoperable request and response API as described above.
* Tools to help agencies with **efficient preparing of records** for release. In particular, tools to make responsive documents accessible could increase the quality and quantity of publicly released documents &mdash; and be broadly useful in the federal government beyond FOIA.

That's a lot of stuff. We most likely will not end up choosing (or being able) to pursue each of them to completion.

What we think is that these are the areas that have the highest return on investment in using technology to modernize how the Freedom of Information Act functions in the United States.

And **we welcome your help!** 18F is an [open source team](#) working in the public domain, and if you'd like to be a part of that: here we are.
